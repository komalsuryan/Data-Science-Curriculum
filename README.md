## Data Science Curriculum: Studying the industry-academia interlude in DS Domain and how this gap can be bridged	
#
As Big data analytics presents an array of applications; its importance is growing for contemporary organisations. The vast amount of data and the competitive advantage of analysing triggers digital transformations throughout many industries. Despite the towering demands of data science, there seems to be a lack of skilled professionals. 
#
To study this gap, we aim to collect the curriculum findings corresponding to more than 100 institutional courses and professional certification training and compare them with the composition of technical and managerial skills required by different industries. We will use the already given Jobs Database (https://github.com/aiskunks/Jobs_Database) for the Data Science domain to closely study the gap. 
To identify the academia-industry disparity, we will collect curriculum samples from various institutions (Indian and International). These institution study programs are mostly post-graduate degree courses offered by leading Indian institutes like IIT, IIM, IISc etc as well as international institutes like Wharton university, Cornell University, Purdue university etc. We will also collect curriculum samples for data science professional certifications programs (like CDS from ADASci, and CAP from INFORMS). 
#
Other than degree courses and certification programs, we will also include a curriculum outline of Data Science Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which include self-paced courses offered by Coursera, Edx, Khan Academy, Udacity, Udemy, Kaggle etc. The curriculum data will be obtained from the official websites of universities, institutes, and EdTech companies.
